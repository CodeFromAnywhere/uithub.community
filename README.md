# uithub.community

Welcome to the Ultra Interesting Technology HUB Community

There likely will be multiple ways to contribute and tinker together here soon. We're at the cutting edge of GenAI and there are loads of areas to be further explored. uithub aims to be interoperable with other open apis as much as possible and is built in an as modular way as possible. This allows anyone to contribute indepdendent modules that can be requested to be added.

Soon these repos may become public, but to start, soon you may find a specification here on how to contribute:
